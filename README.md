equip their lines before the various country deadlines. Since the investments are great and the
number of lines to install is enormous, it is fundamental to agree on standards in the industry while
the process is in its beginning stages. In order to come up with sustainable architecture and
reliable solutions, major line level suppliers have decided to gather and help define the standards
for the industry. The stakes are immense for the pharmaceutical industry. It is always first and
foremost about patient safety. Drug shortages are a global issue that can be reduce by taking
actions as defining standards that will improve the pharmaceutical industry.

Objectives
----------
The major objective of this Round Table is to define the standards concerning open architecture for
Track & Trace in the pharmaceutical industry. Here are the specific objectives in more details:
* Review requirements of the data exchange between the different architecture levels in the
Track &Trace space.
* Presentation of the draft standards that have been defined with major line Track &Trace
suppliers to exchange data to upper level systems.
* Presentation of real industry standard case studies in the electronic industry that have lead
to the setting of the current standards, what have been their issues? How they solved them?
Also, how the new standards brought simplicity amongst serialized lines.
* Open discussion with a question and answer time
* Action plan to implement the new standards
